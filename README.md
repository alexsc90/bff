# Backend for Frontend

In this repo you can find the practice realized during the Backend & Frontend Integration course by [Platzi](https://platzi.com/clases/bff/).  The *Backend for frontend* is the architectural pattern this course intended to implement. For this, it took the project created in other Platzi's courses, which I have completed previously.

I have cloned the project from https://github.com/platzi/curso-backend-for-frontend and started to work from there. The code you can find in here it's the result after the implementations to build a *BFF* backend. If you want to see the work I have done in the prevoius courses go to https://github.com/alexsc90/nodeJs-backend for the [Backend with Node.js course](https://platzi.com/clases/backend-nodejs/) repository, and to https://github.com/alexsc90/passportjs-auth for the repository for the [Authentication with Passport.js](https://github.com/alexsc90/passportjs-auth).
